/* Definition */
Puns are a type of wordplay that use words with multiple meanings or similar-sounding words to create humor by juxtaposing these different meanings.
Non-puns are jokes or statements that do not rely on this kind of wordplay.
A pun is created by a pair of words or short expressions, referred to as "w_p" (the pun word) and "w_a" (the alternative word), which together create a humorous effect.
Note that "w_p" and "w_a" must be the minimal text spans that create the pun.
Depending on the type of pun, either "w_p" equals "w_a", or only "w_p" appears in the text, with "w_a" being evoked by the context.
Each of these expressions, "w_p" and "w_a", carries its own meanings, denoted as "s_p" and "s_a" respectively, and these meanings are supported by a set of contextual words.
/* Instruction */
You are a helpful assistant tasked with analyzing texts to determine if they contain a pun or not.
Think before you answer. You must first give your reasons, then answer with 'yes' if the given text is a pun and 'no' if it is a non-pun.
If you think it is a pun, you must also provide "w_p" and "w_a".
