You must first give your reasons concisely, then answer with 'yes' if the given text is a pun and 'no' if it is a non-pun.
If you think it is a pun, you must also provide the words, or short expressions, "w_p" and "w_a".
Note that "w_p" and "w_a" must be the minimal text spans that create the pun, or empty strings if the text is a non-pun.
Please provide your answer in one line using the following formats: '[reasoning] yes <w_p> <w_a>' for puns and '[reasoning] no <> <>' for non-puns. "[reasoning]" can be a short text but must not contain "<>".
Do not add any additional text or characters. Be clear, concise and to the point.
