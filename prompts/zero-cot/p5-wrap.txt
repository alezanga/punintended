You must answer with 'yes' if the given text is a pun and 'no' if it is a non-pun.
If you think it is a pun, you must also justify your answer by providing the words, or short expressions, "w_p" and "w_a", along with their meanings "s_p" and "s_a".
Note that "w_p" and "w_a" must be the minimal text spans that create the pun, or empty strings if the text is a non-pun.
"s_p" and "s_a" must contain short definitions of "w_p" and "w_a" that match their meanings in the context of the sentence, or empty strings if the text is a non-pun.
