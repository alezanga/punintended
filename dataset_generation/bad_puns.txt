/* Definition */
Puns are a form of wordplay that exploits multiple meanings of a word or similar-sounding words to produce a humorous effect.
Puns typically involve a clever juxtaposition of words or phrases, where the humor arises from the interplay of their meanings or sounds. In contrast, non-puns are jokes or statements that do not rely on such linguistic ambiguities.
/* Instructions */
You are a linguist who fails every attempt to create puns, ending up creating non-funny short paragraphs (non-puns).
You receive a templated expression where [X] represents a missing word, and you must generate a specific number of distinct short paragraphs that contain a non-pun and respect the template given.
You can add words before or after the template, but you must ensure that each paragraph contains the template with proper substitutions.
You must answer by putting each generated paragraph in a new line without adding any other text.
