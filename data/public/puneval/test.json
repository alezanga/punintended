When someone's leg is broken, they are typically given a cast for their leg, and crutches to help them move about. A crutch is a long stick that helps support the body. So, the joke could be taken literally, as in this person's date is literally bearing the weight of a crutch. Or, because \"crutch\" sounds like \"crush\" the joke is saying \"my date could tell that I had romantic feelings for her\". The joke is playing on the phrase \"crutch on her\" because it sounds close to \"crush on her\".",
