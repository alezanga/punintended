The word \"planted\" was cleverly used here because the joke is referring to an agricultural presentation. \"Agricultural\" is a word related to agriculture, which is the practice of growing plants and livestock. A plant is a living organism that grows in the earth and has a stem, leaves, and roots. \"Plant\" is in the word \"planted\". This joke plays on the word \"planted\".",
